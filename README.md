# W3TC-Debug-Bar-Extender-Object-Cache
Allows the W3TC object cache data to be included in the "Object Cache" section for the WP Debug Bar extender.

Place the file w3tc-debug.php in `wp-content/mu-plugins/` to activate. Requires W3TC Object Caching to be enabled and the Debug Bar Extender plugin to be enabled as well.

Renders a useful table of cache misses and how many cache hits exist for any particular ID:group, in the order they are accessed.
